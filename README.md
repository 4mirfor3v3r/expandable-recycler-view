##Contributing

####Issues or Comments

If you have an idea for a feature enhancement or a bug fix, we'd love to know! We handle issue tracking using GitHub's issue system, so please add your issue/comment there.

####Updates and Fixes

We also welcome all pull requests, ideally your work is based off of a request in our GitHub issues. We really love [good commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and atomic commits.

The `dev-4.0.0` branch is used for any incompatible API changes, since they will cause a 4.0.0 release. If your work breaks or changes any existing API's we ask that you target and branch off of the `dev-4.0.0` branch.

If you have a bug fix or adding functionality without affecting current API, you should target and branch off of `master`. This way, we're flexible to pull in bug fixes and additional features as soon as possible.
